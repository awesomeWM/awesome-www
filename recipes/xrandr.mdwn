# Helper for multiple monitors (based on xrandr)

The [[xrandr.lua|xrandr.lua]] script helps when dealing with multiple monitors.
Using this snippet you can set a keybinding where you swap to all possible
arrangements of monitors.

The process of setting up this script is as follows:

1. Create a file called `xrandr.lua` in your file system (preferably in
   awesome's folder) with the [[script|xrandr.lua]] content.

2. Import the script in your `rc.lua`

   ```lua
   local xrandr = require("xrandr")
   ```

3. Create a keybinding to the script in the `globalkeys` table

   Pressing this key binding will open a popup with a possible screen
   arrangement.
   Pressing the key again will replace this popup with the next possibility,
   eventually arriving at "keep the current configuration".

   If the key is not pressed again within four seconds, the configuration
   described in the current popup is applied.

   ```lua
   awful.key({}, "Some Key", function() xrandr.xrandr() end)
   ```
