# Awesome taglist

Here is nice-looking and super easy way to customize taglist. The idea is simple - literally write 'awesome' or 'awesomewm' (if you want to keep 9 tags) in the taglist using characters from the Awesome logo.

To do it you need to install a font which was generated from the svg images of the letters from the logo. Download it from [here](../awesomewm-font.ttf) and place it under `~/.local/share/fonts`. Then name your tags in **rc.lua** using it. The font has two types of letters: uppercase are for the bold characters:

    awful.tag({ "A", "W", "E", "S", "O", "M", "E", "W", "M"},

<div class="screenshot">
[[!img images/awesome-taglist.png alt="awesome taglist screenshot"]]
</div>

and lowercase for the outline characters:

    awful.tag({ "a", "w", "e", "s", "o", "m", "e", "w", "m"},

<div class="screenshot">
[[!img images/awesome-taglist-outline.png alt="awesome taglist screenshot"]]
</div>

Almost done! The last step is to theme it, below is the config which is used for the screenshots above (add it to the **theme.lua**):

    theme.taglist_fg_focus    = "#3992af"
    theme.taglist_fg_occupied = "#164b5d"
    theme.taglist_fg_urgent   = "#ED7572"
    theme.taglist_fg_empty    = "#828282"
    theme.taglist_spacing     = 2
    theme.taglist_font = "awesomewm-font 13"
