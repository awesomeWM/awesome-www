# Awesome taglist

Here is nice-looking and super easy way to customize taglist. The idea is simple - literally write 'awesome' or 'awesomewm' (if you want to keep 9 tags) in the taglist using characters from the Awesome logo.

To do it you need to install font which was generated from the svg images of the letters from the logo. Download it from [here](../awesomewm-font.ttf) and place under `~/.local/share/fonts`. Then name your tags in **rc.lua** using it. Font has two types of letters: uppercase are for the bold characters:

    awful.tag({ "A", "W", "E", "S", "O", "M", "E", "W", "M"},

<div class="screenshot">
[[!img images/awesome-taglist.png alt="awesome taglist screenshot"]]
</div>

and lowercase for the outline characters:

    awful.tag({ "a", "w", "e", "s", "o", "m", "e", "w", "m"},

<div class="screenshot">
[[!img images/awesome-taglist-outline.png alt="awesome taglist screenshot"]]
</div>

Almost done! The last step is to theme it, below is the config which is used for the screenshots above (add it to the **theme.lua**):

    theme.taglist_fg_focus    = "#3992af"
    theme.taglist_fg_occupied = "#164b5d"
    theme.taglist_fg_urgent   = "#ED7572"
    theme.taglist_fg_empty    = "#828282"
    theme.taglist_spacing     = 2
    theme.taglist_font = "awesomewm-font 13"
