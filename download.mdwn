## Building from Source

<p class="standout">
We strongly recommend using the awesome package of your distribution.
</p>

This is because many people who tried to build from source had problems.
[LGI](https://github.com/pavouk/lgi), one of awesome's dependencies, currently
hardcodes the package search path used by Lua 5.1. Part of the reason for this
is that Lua upstream intends Lua to be embedded, which means that detecting an
installed Lua version properly is not easy.

After installing awesome, you can check if you are affected by this problem by
running `awesome -v`. If an error message is displayed instead of LGI version's
number, you are likely affected.
