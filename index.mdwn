# Concepts

A window manager is probably one of the most used software applications in
your day-to-day tasks, along with your web browser, mail reader and text editor.
Power users and programmers have a big range of choice between several tools
for these day-to-day tasks. Some are heavily extensible and configurable.

**awesome** tries to complete these tools with what we miss: an extensible,
highly configurable window manager.

To achieve this goal, **awesome** has been designed as a framework window
manager.
It's extremely fast, small, dynamic and heavily extensible using the
[Lua](http://www.lua.org) programming language.

We provide a documented API to configure and define the behavior of your
window manager.

# Awesome Key Features

<div>
<ul class="awesome">
  <li>Very stable, fast and small codebase and footprint.
  <li>Usage of the asynch <a href="http://xcb.freedesktop.org">XCB</a>
  lib instead of the old synch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">Xlib</a>; <b>awesome</b> has less latency against other WMs.
  <li>Documented source code and API.
  <li>No mouse needed: everything can be performed with the keyboard.
  <li>Real multihead support (XRandR) with per screen desktops (tags).
  <li>Implements many <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org">Freedesktop</a> standards:
  <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html">EWMH</a>, <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory</a>, <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/xembed-spec/xembed-spec-latest.html">XEmbed</a>, <a href="http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/">Desktop Notification</a>, <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/systemtray-spec/systemtray-spec-latest.html">System Tray</a>.
  <li>Does not distinguish between layers: there is no floating or tiled layer.
  <li>Uses tags instead of workspaces: allow to place clients on several tags, and
  display several tags at the same time.
  <li>A lot of Lua extensions to add features: dynamic tagging, widget feeding,
  tabs, layouts, etc.
</ul>
